        <p><i>A hobby is an activity that you do in your spare time for fun.
                Your hobby may be putting together model train sets and driving
                your mom crazy from all the noise.</i></p>
        A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for
        enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies include
        collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic
        pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in
        hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that
        area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing
        fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends
        in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the
        nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means
        of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following
        technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the
        nineteenth century provided workers with more leisure time to engage in
        hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has
        increased with time.
